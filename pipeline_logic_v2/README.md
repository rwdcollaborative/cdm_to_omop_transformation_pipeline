This code implements ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) logic to convert data from multiple common data models—PEDSnet, ACT/i2b2, PCORnet, and TriNetX—into the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) version 5.3.1. It harmonizes source-specific schemas, terminologies, and data conventions into a unified OMOP-compliant structure.
